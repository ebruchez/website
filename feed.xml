It’s a superb machine with a beautiful 27” 5K display. Its thermal design is excellent and even when the fans run, they tend to be pretty silent, unlike the Intel-based MacBook Pro. The machine has been very reliable. (Also, Apple has announced that they are discontinuing it.) For travel this summer I will need a laptop. One of my... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>The 1960 Royal FP "special order"</title><link href="https://blog.bruchez.name/posts/royal-fp-special-order-1960/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The 1960 Royal FP "special order"" /><published>2021-05-04T21:45:00-07:00</published> <updated>2021-05-05T10:54:44-07:00</updated> <id>https://blog.bruchez.name/posts/royal-fp-special-order-1960/</id> <content src="https://blog.bruchez.name/posts/royal-fp-special-order-1960/" /> <author> <name>Erik Bruchez</name> </author> <category term="Typewriters" /> <summary> Introduction I bought this machine right after the start of the Bay Area “shelter-in-place” order related to the COVID-19 pandemic back in April 2020. Since we were all actually sheltering at the time I couldn’t go pick it up immediately. Friends kindly helped get the machine to me, and I eventually got my hands on it in November 2020, where it got to sit in our garage. Recently, just over a y... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Turning off lazy image loading</title><link href="https://blog.bruchez.name/posts/lazy-image-loading/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Turning off lazy image loading" /><published>2021-02-18T13:15:00-08:00</published> <updated>2021-02-18T15:34:50-08:00</updated> <id>https://blog.bruchez.name/posts/lazy-image-loading/</id> <content src="https://blog.bruchez.name/posts/lazy-image-loading/" /> <author> <name>Erik Bruchez</name> </author> <category term="Technology" /> <summary> When switching to my new blog setup, which is based on Jekyll and the Chirpy theme, I wondered why things jittered around when paging down a long post with images. Similarly, using the “End” key to reach the end of the page and then going back up was weird. Finally, printing a blog post or saving it as a PDF was not showing all the images! I discovered that there has been a fad about lazy imag... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Chick Corea has passed away</title><link href="https://blog.bruchez.name/posts/chick-corea/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Chick Corea has passed away" /><published>2021-02-12T11:40:00-08:00</published> <updated>2021-02-16T13:43:45-08:00</updated> <id>https://blog.bruchez.name/posts/chick-corea/</id> <content src="https://blog.bruchez.name/posts/chick-corea/" /> <author> <name>Erik Bruchez</name> </author> <category term="Link Blog" /> <summary> From Chick Corea’s web site: It is with great sadness that we announce that on February 9th, Chick Corea passed away at the age of 79, from a rare form of cancer which was only discovered very recently. Chick Corea I saw Chick Corea in 2019 in Montreux with my wife, dad, brother and sister-in-law. It was the first time I saw him live.

The IBM Memory Typewriter I already own several IBM typewriters in various conditions, and even an IBM Electronic Typewriter 75 (see below), but I was not familiar with the ... </summary> </entry> </feed>
